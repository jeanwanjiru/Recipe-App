           1 package of ramen noodles (discard seasoning packet) <br />
           4cups of shredded green cabbage <br />
           1/2 cup of shredded carrots <br />
           1/4 cup of chopped green onions <br />
           1/4 cup of sliced almonds <br />
           1/4 cup of sunflower seeds <br />
           1/4 cup of rice vinegar <br />
            2 tablespoons of honey <br />
            2 tablespoons of vegetable oil <br />
            1 tablespoon of soy sauce <br />
             1 garlic clove, minced <br />
             Salt and pepper to taste <br />

            <h2 className="text-center">Instructions</h2>
             Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). <br />Break up the ramen noodles into small pieces
            and spread them out  <br />on a baking sheet. Toast them in the preheated
            oven for 5-7 <br />minutes, or until golden brown and crispy. <br /> In a large
            mixing bowl, combine the shredded cabbage, carrots, <br /> green onions,
            almonds, and sunflower seeds. <br /> In a separate mixing bowl, whisk
            together the rice vinegar, honey, <br />vegetable oil, soy sauce, garlic,
            salt, and pepper. <br /> Pour the dressing over the cabbage mixture and
            toss to coat evenly. <br />Add the toasted ramen noodles to the salad and
            toss again. <br />Serve immediately or refrigerate until ready to serve. <br />
            Enjoy your crunchy ramen and cabbage salad!
